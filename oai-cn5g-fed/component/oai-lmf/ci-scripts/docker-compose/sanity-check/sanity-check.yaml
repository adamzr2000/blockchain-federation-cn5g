# OAI CN Configuration File
### This file can be used by all OAI NFs
### Some fields are specific to an NF and will be ignored by other NFs

## NOTE ON YAML ANCHORS ##
# We use YAML anchors to ease the configuration and to avoid duplicating parts of the configuration.
# This is especially true for the SNSSAIs, as we have to define them for multiple NFs.
# Please note that the use of anchors is not mandatory, and you can define the SNSSAI in each NF yourself.
# You can read more about anchors here: https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#anchors-and-aliases

############# Common configuration

# Log level for all the NFs
log_level:
  general: debug

# If you enable registration, the other NFs will use the NRF discovery mechanism
register_nf:
  general: yes

http_version: 2

############## SBI Interfaces
### Each NF takes its local SBI interfaces and remote interfaces from here, unless it gets them using NRF discovery mechanisms
